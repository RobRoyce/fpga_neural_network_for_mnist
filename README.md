# FPGA Neural Network for Recognizing the MNIST Data Set

This project is based on an assignment for UCLA's undergraduate-level course -- Digital Design Laboratory

We implement a custom clock divider, vga controller, 7-segment controller, and Xilinx ROM and RAM IPs. The neural network is trained to recognize the MNIST dataset on an x86 machine, and the weights are then transfered and implemented in the ROM IP. The VGA controller displays the MNIST hand-written digits on a compatible monitor, and the network prediction is displayed on a 7-segment display.
