* seq definitions file
This file contains many of the constants used throughout the design. It has the
number of registers, the bit-widths, the op codes, etc.


* model uart file
This file contains a bunch of tasks (functions) that, so far as I can tell, are
literally only here for simulation purposes (i.e. it acts like a computer or
device that we might be interested in communicating with from the overall
design). Some of the tasks do nothing, such as tskRxData, which I can't find
reference to in any other modules.

* nexys 3 file
This is the top level module. It's what connects all of the submodules with the
board. Hence, it is responsible for IO from/to the buttons, LED's, switches,
etc.
