  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

** Ideas for improvement

There are a lot of conditionals going on. We could possibly reduce the
number of multiplexers by reducing the number of if-else-if statements.
